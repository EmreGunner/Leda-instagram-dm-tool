# Chrome Web Store Publishing Guide

Complete guide to publish the BulkDM Chrome Extension to Chrome Web Store.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Google Chrome Developer Account**
   - Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
   - Pay one-time $5 registration fee (if not already paid)
   - Complete developer account setup

2. **Extension Package Ready**
   - All files updated with production URLs
   - Icons and assets prepared
   - Version number set correctly

## 🔧 Step 1: Update Extension for Production

### Update URLs in Extension

Before publishing, update the extension to use your production URLs:

1. **Option A: Use Chrome Storage (Recommended)**
   - Users can configure URLs after installation
   - More flexible for different environments

2. **Option B: Hardcode Production URLs**
   - Update `popup.js` and `background.js` with your Netlify URLs
   - Replace `localhost` URLs with your actual deployment URLs

### Update manifest.json

Make sure your `manifest.json` includes your production domain:

```json
"host_permissions": [
  "https://www.instagram.com/*",
  "https://instagram.com/*",
  "https://your-app.netlify.app/*",
  "https://your-backend.netlify.app/*"
]
```

## 📦 Step 2: Prepare Extension Package

1. **Create a ZIP file** with these files:
   ```

   └── icons/
       ├── icon16.png
       ├── icon48.png

2. **Exclude unnecessary files**:
   - Don't include `.git`, `node_modules`, or development files
   - Only include files needed for the extension to run
